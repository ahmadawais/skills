# functional-style
- Use pure functions only — no classes, `this`, or `new` (except `Map`/`Set`/`Error`). Confidence: 0.95
- No prototypes, inheritance, instance methods, or stateful objects with methods. Confidence: 0.95
- Pure functions take data and return data; use plain objects or arrays for data. Confidence: 0.95
- Compose functions instead of inheriting; pass state explicitly as parameters. Confidence: 0.90
- Keep data transforms immutable. Confidence: 0.90
- Functions with more than one param should be passed as an object for readability and maintainability. Confidence: 0.95
